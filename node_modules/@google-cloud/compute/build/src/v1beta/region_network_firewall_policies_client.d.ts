     * in [this document](https://github.com/googleapis/gax-nodejs/blob/main/client-libraries.md#creating-the-client-instance).
     * The common options are:
     * @param {object} [options.credentials] - Credentials object.
     * @param {string} [options.credentials.client_email]
     * @param {string} [options.credentials.private_key]
     * @param {string} [options.email] - Account email address. Required when

     * @param {string} [options.keyFilename] - Full path to the a .json, .pem, or
     *     .p12 key downloaded from the Google Developers Console. If you provide
     *     a path to a JSON file, the projectId option below is not necessary.
     *     NOTE: .pem and .p12 require you to specify options.email as well.
     * @param {number} [options.port] - The port on which to connect to
     *     the remote host.
     * @param {string} [options.projectId] - The project ID from the Google
     *     Developer's Console, e.g. 'grape-spaceship-123'. We will also check
     *     the environment variable GCLOUD_PROJECT for your project ID. If your

     *     {@link https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials Application Default Credentials},

     *     API remote host.
     * @param {gax.ClientConfig} [options.clientConfig] - Client configuration override.
     *     Follows the structure of {@link gapicConfig}.

    *
    * @param {Object} request
    *   The request object that will be sent.
    * @param {string} request.filter
    *   A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
    *   Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
    *   expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
    *   API improvement proposal AIP-160.
    *   These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.
    *
    *   If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
    *   operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
    *   must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
    *   must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.
    *
    *   For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
    *   exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
    *   `name != example-instance`.
    *
    *   The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
    *   For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
    *   ```
    *   labels.owner:*
    *   ```
    *
    *   You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
    *   `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
    *   if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
    *   on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.
    *
    *   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
    *   parentheses. For example:
    *   ```
    *   (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
    *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
    *   ```
    *   By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
    *   can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
    *   For example:
    *   ```
    *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
    *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
    *   (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
    *   ```
    *
    *   If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
    *   (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
    *   without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
    *
    *   `fieldname eq unquoted literal`
    *   `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
    *   `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
    *   `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`
    *
    *   The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
    *   The literal value must match the entire field.
    *
    *   For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
    *   you would use `name ne .*instance`.
    *
    *   You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
    *   expressions.
    * @param {number} request.maxResults
    *   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
    *   If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
    *   Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
    *   the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
    *   `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    * @param {string} request.orderBy
    *   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
    *   are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
    *
    *   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
    *   timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
    *   results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
    *   reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
    *   resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
    *
    *   Currently, only sorting by `name` or
    *   `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    * @param {string} request.pageToken
    *   Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
    *   `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
    *   the next page of results.
    * @param {string} request.project
    *   Project ID for this request.
    * @param {string} request.region
    *   Name of the region scoping this request.
    * @param {boolean} request.returnPartialSuccess
    *   Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
    *   of failure. The default value is false.
    *
    *   For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
    *   single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
    *   with an error code.
    * @param {object} [options]
    *   Call options. See {@link https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/google-gax/latest/interfaces/CallOptions.html|CallOptions} for more details.
    * @returns {Promise} - The promise which resolves to an array.
    *   The first element of the array is Array of {@link protos.google.cloud.compute.v1beta.FirewallPolicy|FirewallPolicy}.
    *   The client library will perform auto-pagination by default: it will call the API as many
    *   times as needed and will merge results from all the pages into this array.
    *   Note that it can affect your quota.
