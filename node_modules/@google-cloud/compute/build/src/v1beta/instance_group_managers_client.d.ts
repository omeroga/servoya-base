     * Retrieves the list of managed instance groups and groups them by zone.
     *
     * To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
     * `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.
     *
     * `for`-`await`-`of` syntax is used with the iterable to get response elements on-demand.
     * @param {Object} request
     *   The request object that will be sent.
     * @param {string} request.filter
     *   A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
     *   Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
     *   expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
     *   API improvement proposal AIP-160.
     *   These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.
     *
     *   If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
     *   operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
     *   must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
     *   must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.
     *
     *   For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
     *   exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
     *   `name != example-instance`.
     *
     *   The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
     *   For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
     *   ```
     *   labels.owner:*
     *   ```
     *
     *   You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
     *   `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
     *   if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
     *   on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.
     *
     *   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
     *   parentheses. For example:
     *   ```
     *   (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
     *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
     *   ```
     *   By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
     *   can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
     *   For example:
     *   ```
     *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
     *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
     *   (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
     *   ```
     *
     *   If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
     *   (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
     *   without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
     *
     *   `fieldname eq unquoted literal`
     *   `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
     *   `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
     *   `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`
     *
     *   The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
     *   The literal value must match the entire field.
     *
     *   For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
     *   you would use `name ne .*instance`.
     *
     *   You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
     *   expressions.
     * @param {boolean} request.includeAllScopes
     *   Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
     *   global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
     *   after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
     *   include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
     *   types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
     *   scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
     *   will be included.
     * @param {number} request.maxResults
     *   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
     *   If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
     *   Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
     *   the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
     *   `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
     * @param {string} request.orderBy
     *   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
     *   are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
     *
     *   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
     *   timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
     *   results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
     *   reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
     *   resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
     *
     *   Currently, only sorting by `name` or
     *   `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
     * @param {string} request.pageToken
     *   Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
     *   `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get

    * Retrieves a list of managed instance groups that are contained within the

    *
    * @param {Object} request
    *   The request object that will be sent.
    * @param {string} request.filter
    *   A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
    *   Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
    *   expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
    *   API improvement proposal AIP-160.
    *   These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.
    *
    *   If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
    *   operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
    *   must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
    *   must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.
    *
    *   For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
    *   exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
    *   `name != example-instance`.
    *
    *   The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
    *   For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
    *   ```
    *   labels.owner:*
    *   ```
    *
    *   You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
    *   `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
    *   if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
    *   on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.
    *
    *   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
    *   parentheses. For example:
    *   ```
    *   (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
    *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
    *   ```
    *   By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
    *   can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
    *   For example:
    *   ```
    *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
    *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
    *   (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
    *   ```
    *
    *   If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
    *   (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
    *   without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
    *
    *   `fieldname eq unquoted literal`
    *   `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
    *   `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
    *   `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`
    *
    *   The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
    *   The literal value must match the entire field.
    *
    *   For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
    *   you would use `name ne .*instance`.
    *
    *   You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
    *   expressions.
    * @param {number} request.maxResults
    *   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
    *   If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
    *   Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
    *   the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
    *   `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    * @param {string} request.orderBy
    *   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
    *   are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
    *
    *   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
    *   timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
    *   results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
    *   reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
    *   resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
    *
    *   Currently, only sorting by `name` or
    *   `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    * @param {string} request.pageToken
    *   Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
    *   `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
    *   the next page of results.
    * @param {string} request.project
    *   Project ID for this request.
    * @param {boolean} request.returnPartialSuccess

    *   of failure. The default value is false.
    *
    *   For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
    *   single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
    *   with an error code.
    * @param {string} request.zone
    *   The name of thezone where the managed

    * @param {object} [options]
    *   Call options. See {@link https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/google-gax/latest/interfaces/CallOptions.html|CallOptions} for more details.

    /**
     * Equivalent to `listErrors`, but returns a NodeJS Stream object.
     * @param {Object} request
     *   The request object that will be sent.
     * @param {string} request.filter
     *   A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
     *   Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
     *   expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
     *   API improvement proposal AIP-160.
     *   These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.
     *
     *   If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
     *   operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
     *   must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
     *   must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.
     *
     *   For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
     *   exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
     *   `name != example-instance`.
     *
     *   The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
     *   For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
     *   ```
     *   labels.owner:*
     *   ```
     *
     *   You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
     *   `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
     *   if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
     *   on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.
     *
     *   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
     *   parentheses. For example:
     *   ```
     *   (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
     *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
     *   ```
     *   By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
     *   can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
     *   For example:
     *   ```
     *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
     *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
     *   (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
     *   ```
     *
     *   If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
     *   (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
     *   without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
     *
     *   `fieldname eq unquoted literal`
     *   `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
     *   `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
     *   `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`
     *
     *   The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
     *   The literal value must match the entire field.
     *
     *   For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
     *   you would use `name ne .*instance`.
     *
     *   You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
     *   expressions.
     * @param {string} request.instanceGroupManager
     *   The name of the managed instance group.
     *   It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an
     *   unsigned long integer: must match regexp pattern:
     *   (?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)|1-9{0,19}.
     * @param {number} request.maxResults
     *   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
     *   If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
     *   Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
     *   the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
     *   `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
     * @param {string} request.orderBy
     *   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
     *   are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

     *   For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can

     *   The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.

    /**
     * Equivalent to `listPerInstanceConfigs`, but returns an iterable object.
     *
     * `for`-`await`-`of` syntax is used with the iterable to get response elements on-demand.
     * @param {Object} request
     *   The request object that will be sent.
     * @param {string} request.filter
     *   A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
     *   Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
     *   expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
     *   API improvement proposal AIP-160.
     *   These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.
     *
     *   If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
     *   operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
     *   must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
     *   must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.
     *
     *   For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
     *   exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
     *   `name != example-instance`.
     *
     *   The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
     *   For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
     *   ```
     *   labels.owner:*
     *   ```
     *
     *   You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
     *   `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
     *   if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
     *   on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.
     *
     *   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
     *   parentheses. For example:
     *   ```
     *   (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
     *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
     *   ```
     *   By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
     *   can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
     *   For example:
     *   ```
     *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
     *   (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
     *   (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
     *   ```
     *
     *   If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
     *   (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
     *   without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
     *
     *   `fieldname eq unquoted literal`
     *   `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
     *   `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
     *   `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`
     *
     *   The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
     *   The literal value must match the entire field.
     *
     *   For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
     *   you would use `name ne .*instance`.
     *
     *   You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
     *   expressions.
     * @param {string} request.instanceGroupManager
     *   The name of the managed instance group. It should conform to RFC1035.
     * @param {number} request.maxResults
     *   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
     *   If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
     *   Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
     *   the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
     *   `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
     * @param {string} request.orderBy
     *   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
     *   are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
     *
     *   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
     *   timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
     *   results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
     *   reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
     *   resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
     *
     *   Currently, only sorting by `name` or
     *   `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
     * @param {string} request.pageToken
     *   Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
     *   `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
     *   the next page of results.
     * @param {string} request.project
     *   Project ID for this request.
     * @param {boolean} request.returnPartialSuccess
     *   Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
     *   of failure. The default value is false.
     *
     *   For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
     *   single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
     *   with an error code.
     * @param {string} request.zone
     *   The name of thezone
     *   where the managed instance group is located.
     *   It should conform to RFC1035.
     * @param {object} [options]
     *   Call options. See {@link https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/google-gax/latest/interfaces/CallOptions.html|CallOptions} for more details.
     * @returns {Object}
     *   An iterable Object that allows {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols | async iteration }.
     *   When you iterate the returned iterable, each element will be an object representing
     *   {@link protos.google.cloud.compute.v1beta.PerInstanceConfig|PerInstanceConfig}. The API will be called under the hood as needed, once per the page,
     *   so you can stop the iteration when you don't need more results.
     *   Please see the {@link https://github.com/googleapis/gax-nodejs/blob/master/client-libraries.md#auto-pagination | documentation }
     *   for more details and examples.
